## Design Patterns

Observer & Composite pattern discussion
<img src="images/design-patterns/observer-composite.jpg" width=750>
### Composite
- Player will be a composite of different classes
  - Health
  - Hoverboard (weapon)
  - Score
  

### Observer
- Each Biff enemy will notify the player observer which will act accordingly:
  - If biff gets killed, +1 point is added to score.
  - If biff gets over to the end of the left screen without getting killed, a life is taken away from the player.
